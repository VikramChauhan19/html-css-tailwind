                    <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Vikram Chauhan, a final-year student with a passion for web development and modern frontend technologies. I enjoy designing and building responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. I am constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and frameworks to create clean, efficient, and visually appealing web projects. Beyond coding, I am interested in problem-solving, creative design, and contributing to projects that make a meaningful impact. My goal is to combine functionality with aesthetics to deliver engaging web experiences.
